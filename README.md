# EXERCISE: Fetching Data from PokeApi with a React Component

1. Create a React component that fetches data from the following API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ ;
2. Implement a button and a text-type input. In the text-type input we'll write the Pokémon name and when we press the button it'll trigger the fetch;
3. From the data we have to extract: Pokémon Name, Sprite, Base Experience and Abilities.

# TIPS:
1. To show all Abilities use map method;
2. For the sprite use "front_default".
